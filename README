Build Instructions

	First install libspotify following their instructions

	Then to build this library execute:
		phpize
		./configure --with-spotify
		make
	You might need some packages required for building PHP extensions.

	Now configure PHP to use the new extension, by adding a line in your php.ini

		extension=<path to extensions>/spotify.so
