Build Instructions

	First install libspotify following their instructions

	Then to build this library execute:
		phpize
		./configure --with-spotify
		make
	You might need some packages required for building PHP extensions.

	Now configure PHP to use the new extension, by adding a line in your php.ini

		extension=<path to extensions>/spotify.so

There is additional user documentation in the doc.html

Developer docs:
	libspotify only allows one session per process.
	Each sp_session instance is wrapped in a php_spotify_session
	There can only be one php_spotify_session per process which is stored in EG(persistent_list)
	
	When a login occurs
		First check if a php_spotify_session already exists
			If it does check we are logging in with the same username
				If not, error out.
		Otherwise create a new php_spotify_session and session.
			The php_spotify_session contains pthread_t and other syncronisation objects

	The php_spotify_session will be deleted when the PHP process ends
